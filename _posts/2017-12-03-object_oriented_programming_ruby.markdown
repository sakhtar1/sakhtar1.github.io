Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming language model organized around objects rather than "actions" and data rather than logic. Objects are manipulated rather than the logic required to manipulate them. Therefore, instead of giving importance to the logic used to manipulate objects, importance is given to objects we want to manipulate.

In ruby objects are a representation of the real world like books, luggage, cars etc. 


The concepts and rules used in object-oriented programming provide these important benefits:

1. The concept of a data class makes it possible to define subclasses of data objects that share some or all of the main class characteristics. Called inheritance, this property of OOP forces a more thorough data analysis, reduces development time, and ensures more accurate coding.
2. Since a class defines only the data it needs to be concerned with, when an instance of that class (an object) is run, the code will not be able to accidentally access other program data. This characteristic of data hiding provides greater system security and avoids unintended data corruption.
3. The definition of a class is reuseable not only by the program for which it is initially created but also by other object-oriented programs (and, for this reason, can be more easily distributed for use in networks).
4. The concept of data classes allows a programmer to create any new data type that is not already defined in the language itself.

Therefore OOP is perfect for an application that grows in complexity and size and is difficult to mantain. Any small changes in the program won't affect the bigger picture. Object oriented programming allows programmers to create containers for data that could be changed and manipulated without affecting the entire program. So instead of a massive blob of dependency, small sections of code perform specific parts of a program so that each of these small parts interact with each other, and any small change of a particular section won't affect the application itself.
