Object Orientation has been the most difficult for me to get through. Intro to ruby, Procedural Ruby, HTML & CSS, they came pretty easily in terms of working through the labs and understanding how to work through them. Of course I’m grateful to the fact that I have a few years of experience working in this field and constantly working around code. However object oriented ruby definitely made me sweat. At times I pulled my hair, grinded my teeth and drank extra cups of coffee to get through them.The amount of research also led to more sites I can now jump to for extra practice. However, I’m not done yet I have my final projects to get through for this section, which definitely will be a part of my next blog. Wish me luck!
