Compared to other languages HTML is pretty straight-forward sort of like Python. I worked with HTML few years ago when I was playing around trying to create my own dummy website of course locally hosted. Sites like youtube, codeschool, codecademy kind of pushed me to play around with different aspects of it using CSS alongside it. You can't have HTML without CSS (maybe you can, but I like the two working together). What I really like about HTML, even if I take 5 months break from it, it comes back automatically when I start working with it again.
