Sinatra's final project was to build a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Destroy) application that incorporates many of the lessons that we learned throughout the SQL/Rack/ActiveRecord/Sinatra section. My final project was Techtionary. Learning so much at once, sometimes all the tech jargons we come across can be a little overwhelming, therefore I decided to create a Sinatra app that allowed users to store all the tech jargons they feel is important to them. 

When I was working on my CLI Gem Project, I remembered we had videos and walkthroughs that guided us, with sinatra you had to create the directories and files needed. I didn't mind this at all b/c it allowed me to recognize and understand all the gems I'm installing like 'bcrypt' for secure passwords. 

One interesting issue I came across was creating a table, model, and controller called 'tech' and ActiveRecord not being able to recognize it. I had a difficult time with this issue as ActiveRecord kept changing my tables to 'teches'. I worked with a tech coach and realized that this was a rarity. Sometimes ActiveRecord isn't able to recognize your table and can change the name, therefore even though my forms were working, an error would arise if I tried to submit them. I got over this hurdle by changing the name of the table. Now it may sound like this was a tedious issue, but I did learn something new. By clicking on the word you want to change, twice until its highlighted, then pressing on 'command m' you're able to highlight this word, every instance it shows up on that specific script, and change it all together. 

I also used bootstrap on my app, which helped make it look more alive. 

This was definitley a  project that I thorougly enjoyed. I'm definitley excited for what rails holds.
